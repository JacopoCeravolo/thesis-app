I need you to extract STIX 2.1 objects from the following threat intelligence report. 

Please identify the following types of objects: 
- Threat Actors
- Malware
- Tools
- Attack Patterns
- Indicators
- Vulnerabilities
- Identities
- Infrastructure
- Campaigns
- Intrusion Sets

For each object identified, extract the required properties according to the STIX 2.1 specification.

Also identify relationships between these objects. Common relationship types include:
- uses (threat-actor → malware/tool)
- targets (threat-actor → identity/vulnerability)
- indicates (indicator → malware/campaign)
- mitigates (course-of-action → attack-pattern/vulnerability)
- delivers (malware → malware)
- exploits (malware/tool → vulnerability)

Return the results as a single JSON array containing STIX objects and their relationships.
Each object should have at minimum:
- id (in format "type--uuid")
- type
- name (if applicable)
- description (if available)

Here is the report text:
[TEXT_CONTENT]

Return just the JSON array of STIX objects, nothing else. Format your response as valid JSON.
